# Jonas's Javascript Course Work

This a repo with my collection of Jonas's JS Course Work.

- [Udemy Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

- Contains all the Challenges and Assignments.

- Contains a coding template which I used for all the challenges.

- It comes with `eslint`, `stylelint` & `prettier` pre-configured. You can run `npm i -g eslint stylelint prettier` to install them.

- Run `npm i` to install all the dependencies.

Also, I recommend to install _Live Server_ , _Stylelint_, _Eslint_ & _Prettier_ plugin for VS Code.
