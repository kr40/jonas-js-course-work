# Jonas's Javascript Course Work

This a repo with my collection of Jonas's JS Course Work.

- [Udemy Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

- Contains all the Challenges and Assignments.

- Contains a coding template which I used for all the challenges.

## Usage of the template

- `npm run dev` for the development server with live reload.

It comes with `eslint`, `stylelint` & `prettier` pre-configured. You can run `npm i -g eslint stylelint prettier` to install them.
